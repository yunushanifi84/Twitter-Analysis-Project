# Twitter User Data Analysis and Interest-based Matching Tool

## Overview
This project aims to analyze Twitter user data stored in local JSON files to identify and match users with shared interests. Leveraging graph theory and custom data structures, it organizes and visualizes data efficiently, providing insights into user interactions on Twitter.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or newer
- Required Python libraries:
  - `faker`
  - `tqdm`
  - `networkx`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `nltk`

### Installation
To install the necessary Python libraries, use the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running the Application
To start the application, run the main.py script:
```bash
python main.py
```
## Features
- Processes Twitter user data from local JSON files.
- Utilizes hash tables and search algorithms for matching users based on shared interests.
- Employs networkx and matplotlib for visualizing user relationships and networks.
- Features a GUI built with Tkinter for easier user interaction.

## Data Preparation
Ensure your Twitter user data is in JSON format, including necessary attributes for analysis and matching algorithms to function properly.

## Usage Example
1. Generate or load user data through the GUI.
2. Explore visualized user networks and relationships.
3. Analyze and match users based on shared interests.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.6 or newer
- Required Python libraries: `faker`, `tqdm`, `networkx`, `matplotlib`, `nltk`
